## What does it do?

FakeDrop allows devices connected to the same network to send files to the host machine.

It works as an Apple AirDrop alternative for cross-platform usage.

Just scan the QR code with your mobile device and send the files from your browser!

## Disclaimer

Code is a little scuffed because I wanted to not make this a react app for once and just use vanilla html/css/js in the frontend.
I have no excuse for the backend lmao I just wanted to make this quick and simple

Enjoy!
